These images show phantoms, obtained by printing digital vascular structures on polyurethane films and imaged using a handheld photoacoustic probe. The phantom has lines (vertical, horizontal and at different angles), used to test the angular sensitivity of photoacoustic probes. Source: Francis, Kalloor Joseph, Yoeri E.
