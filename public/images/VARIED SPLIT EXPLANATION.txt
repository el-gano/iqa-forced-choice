[Reasoning]
Mice = Most real examples we have, we want to focus on this
Mice Phantom subset = Very simple and 'boring' images, not necessarily focus, agar based phantoms
SWFD = Two different ways (semi circle, and multisegment arrays) of real forearm scans, but slightly uninteresting images)
Visualsonics = Included for variety of systems and more varied research basis
Acousticx = Included for variety of systems and more varied research basis

NNE is skipped due to instability of quality judgement
ZENODO is skipped due to nature of dataset which leads to evaluation being potentially random

Total Estimate = 1200 seconds of content (~16min)
