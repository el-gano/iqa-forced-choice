These images show a human wrist imaged using a handheld photoacoustic probe. What you see is the skin layer on top and cross-sections of several blood vessels (only top and bottom region visible due to limited view and band-limited nature). Some reflection artifacts from the bone are visible. Source: Xia, Wenfeng, Mithun Kuniyil Ajith Singh, Efthymios Maneas, Naoto Sato, Yusuke Shigeta, Toshitaka Agano, Sebastian Ourselin, Simeon J.
